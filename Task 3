In the “Funny” audio file I could only hear two phrases that are repeated numerous number of times that does not follow any “definite pattern” what so ever.

The 2 phrases are as follows:
1->never gonna give you up......(denoting by $)
2->never gonna let you down......(denoting by &)

Here we can interrelate the two phrases($ and &) with ASCII codes....

The phrase $ is repeated 56 times in the whole audio 

The phrase & is repeated 48 times in the whole audio

If we represent the “up” in the phrase $ and “down” in the phrase & then we get the following representation:->

00110100011101010110010000110001011011110101111101101001001101010101111101101110001100010110001100110011

Again if we convert the whole thing into decimal form into 13 parts with 8 bits each then we get a code using ASCII conversion :->
