The Julia code in the task 2 contains the following things that are implemented:

1->Random function is used whose main function is to generator random numbers {using Random}

2->round(Int64,a,Rounddown) is used to round off the value of a(i.e in 64 bits representation of integer) to the base of Rounddown.The job of the f(a:Float64) is to add 1 to the 4 times the rounded value of the integer a.

3->f(a::Int64) is used to multiply 2 to the value a and the integer a is stored in 64 bits representation of integer.

4->in function(a::String) the following takes place:
* The string a is converted into vector s with integer representation of 8 bits.

* x is a vector which stores the return value of the function randsubseq():

* The setdiff() works as follows:
Construct the set of elements in S1 and eliminating S2 elements.Maintain the order of the arrays.Note that both arguments must be collections and both will be itterated over.
* o is an empty vector that the has length of the vector s.
* o[x] stores the return value of the s[x] converted into type Float64.
* o[y] stores the return value of the s[y] converted into type Int64.

The “flag” that is to be found is a string.The string characters are converted into its ASCII equivalents.

The ASCII values present are:

102,108,97,103,123,109,117,49,116,105,112,51,95,100,53,54,99,104,115,95,119,101,106,48,125

This means that these are the ASCII value of the characters that are present in the string and not among the random numbers.

Therefore the “flag” is a string that consists of the following ASCII numbers.
