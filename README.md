# TASK 2:

Practically to be honest this task did see scary at first(mainly cuz I didn't know the language) but later on seeing the functions and exploring the functions of the code it became too simple to be honest.

I wrote the logic and then also used that logic to reach my ultimate goal that is to recover the flag in the code.

Ofc that is hidden in the output.
